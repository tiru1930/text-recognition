Text-recognition using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network on IIIT 5k word dataset

#download dataset and keep it in data directory
	https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/SceneTextUnderstanding/IIIT5K.html

#install lmdb

#run prepare_lmdb_data_for_IIIT5k.py to prepare dataset

#run Train.py to train the model (Need to fineTune for better performance working)

#demo.py can get the output for single image
